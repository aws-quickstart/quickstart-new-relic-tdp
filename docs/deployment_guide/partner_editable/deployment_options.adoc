// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacksets/create[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a stack set^]. This recommended option is useful when your environment includes EC2 instances that span across multiple Regions and accounts.
* https://fwd.aws/qvQnn[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a single AWS Account^].  This option is useful for testing or troubleshooting, for example when you want to quickly deploy the stack in a given Region, and then test the automation to confirm that it works as expected.

This Partner Solution provides a single template for both options. If using a stack set, you can also launch the Quick Start using the command line.
