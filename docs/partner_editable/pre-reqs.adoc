==== Prepare your AWS account

. You need https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html#jf_administrator[Administrator] access to your AWS account so that you can deploy, manage and test the solution. If you are using https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/[AWS Control Tower], it is recommended you deploy the solution to AWS Control Tower https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/how-control-tower-works.html#what-is-master[management account] in your home region, where the AWS Control Tower https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/features/#Landing_Zone[landing zone] was set up.
. Make sure the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html[permissions] for AWS CloudFormation StackSets have been setup in your AWS account. It is recommended that you use self-managed permissions for a better security posture and control. In case you are using the AWS Control Tower, you should use the pre-configured IAM Roles, `AWSControlTowerStackSetRole` and `AWSControlTowerExecution`.
. The solution relies on https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/[AWS Systems Manager] (SSM) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html[Automation] and requires that EC2 instances have the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html[AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent)] installed.  SSM Agent is preinstalled, by default, on many Windows and Linux Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). If you are using an AMI that doesn't have the agent installed, you must manually install the SSM Agent for https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-manual-agent-install.html[Linux] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-install-win.html[Windows].
