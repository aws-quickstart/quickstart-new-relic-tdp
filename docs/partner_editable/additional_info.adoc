[#Deploy_using_Stack_Sets]
==== Deploy using Stack Sets ====
This solution requires that you deploy the StackSet instances in your AWS accounts across all regions where you plan to have the New Relic Infrastructure agent installed on your EC2 instances.
Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.

. Create a StackSet named `NR-EC2InfraSSMAutomation` in your AWS account. It is recommended that you create it in your StackSet administration account or your Control Tower management account, but you can use any other account, if necessary. Use your https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html[AWS account ID] in place of `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` placeholder. The template accepts your https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/new-relic-license-key[New Relic license key] as a parameter. Use it in place of `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` placeholder. Use the actual IAM Role names for your StackSet administration and execution roles, for the placeholders; `STACK_SET_ADMINISTRATION_ROLE_NAME` and `STACK_SET_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME`, respectively.

----
aws cloudformation create-stack-set \
    --stack-set-name NR-EC2InfraSSMAutomation \
    --template-body file:./templates/NR-EC2InfraAgentSSMAutomation.yml \
    --description "SSM Automation workflow for installing New Relic Infrastructure Agent on EC2 instances" \
    --parameters ParameterKey=NewRelicLicenseKey,ParameterValue=<NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
    --administration-role-arn arn:aws:iam::<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<STACK_SET_ADMINISTRATION_ROLE_NAME> \
    --execution-role-name <STACK_SET_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME> \
    --permission-model SELF_MANAGED
----

After the command returns successfully, the StackSet creation starts. You can check the status of the StackSet creation after a few seconds. To verify the StackSet was successfully created, run the below command, and make sure the StackSet name, viz. `NR-EC2InfraSSMAutomation` is returned.
+
----
aws cloudformation describe-stack-set --stack-set-name NR-EC2InfraSSMAutomation --query "StackSet.StackSetName"
----

. Next, create instances of the `NR-EC2InfraSSMAutomation` StackSet across various AWS accounts and regions where you plan to launch EC2 instances. The following `create-stack-instances` example creates instances in two accounts and in four US regions.
+
----
aws cloudformation create-stack-instances \
    --stack-set-name NR-EC2InfraSSMAutomation \
    --accounts 123456789012 223456789012 \
    --regions us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-1 us-west-2
----
+
After the command returns successfully, the Stack instances creation operation starts and an `OperationId` is returned. You can check the status of the operation after a few seconds. To verify the operation was successfully completed, run the below command, and make sure the status, viz. `SUCCEEDED` is returned. Use the returned `OperationId` value in place of `OPERATION_ID` placeholder.
+
----
aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation \
    --stack-set-name NR-EC2InfraSSMAutomation \
    --operation-id <OPERATION_ID> \
    --query "StackSetOperation.Status"
----

== Test the deployment
To test the deployment, log in to your AWS account, choose the Region where the StackSet instance is deployed, and launch an EC2 instance. Confirm the following:

* Review the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent[requirements for the infrastructure agent] to confirm that it supports the the AMI.
* Confirm that the SSM Agent is installed. The agent can be installed either by default or manually, preferably at launch or afterwards.
* Confirm that the instance profile has permissions to run SSM commands on the EC2 instance. If you can't create a new instance profile or use an existing one, use the profile that was created by the deployment (`NRSSMInstanceProfile`). The deployment creates the instance profile when you set the CloudFormation template parameter `CreateEC2InstanceProfile` to `Yes`. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-profile.html[Create an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager^].
* Add the tag named `NR-Infrastructure` and set the value to *Install*. This tag key-value pair allows the automation workflow to automatically install the {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure agent on the EC2 instance as soon as it is launched and in running state.

Connect to your EC2 instance, open a terminal client, and run the `newrelic-infra --version` command. Running this command displays the {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure agent version information and confirms that the agent was successfully installed on the EC2 instance. Now you can monitor the instance from your {partner-product-short-name} account.

Log in to your https://one.newrelic.com/[New Relic account], navigate to the https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer[entity explorer], and look for the EC2 instance on the *Hosts* page. You can launch more instances using a variety of different AMIs that are supported by the {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure agent. These instances automatically show up in your {partner-product-short-name} account.

All information exchanged between your instances and the {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure agent is delivered securely. The agent communicates over HTTPS, using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
