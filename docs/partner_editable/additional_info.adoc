== Test the deployment
To test the deployment, log in to your AWS account, choose the Region where the StackSet instance is deployed, and launch an EC2 instance. Confirm the following:

* Review the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent[requirements for the infrastructure agent] to confirm that it supports the the AMI.
* Confirm that the SSM Agent is installed. The agent can be installed either by default or manually, preferably at launch or afterwards.
* Confirm that the instance profile has permissions to run SSM commands on the EC2 instance. If you can't create a new instance profile or use an existing one, use the profile that was created by the deployment (`NRSSMInstanceProfile`). The deployment creates the instance profile when you set the CloudFormation template parameter `CreateEC2InstanceProfile` to `Yes`. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-profile.html[Create an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager^].
* Add the tag named `NR-Infrastructure` and set the value to *Install*. This tag key-value pair allows the automation workflow to automatically install the {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure agent on the EC2 instance as soon as it is launched and in running state.

Connect to your EC2 instance, open a terminal client, and run the `newrelic-infra --version` command. Running this command displays the {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure agent version information and confirms that the agent was successfully installed on the EC2 instance. Now you can monitor the instance from your {partner-product-short-name} account.

Log in to your https://one.newrelic.com/[New Relic account], navigate to the https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer[entity explorer], and look for the EC2 instance on the *Hosts* page. You can launch more instances using a variety of different AMIs that are supported by the {partner-product-short-name} infrastructure agent. These instances automatically show up in your {partner-product-short-name} account.
