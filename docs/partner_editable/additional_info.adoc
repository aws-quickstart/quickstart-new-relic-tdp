== Test the deployment
To test the solution, log into your AWS account and make sure you choose a region where StackSet instance is deployed, and launch an EC2 instance. Make sure that:

. AMI is supported by New Relic Infrastructure agent after reviewing the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/requirements-infrastructure-agent[requirements for the infrastructure agent].
. The SSM Agent is installed by default for the chosen AMI, or install it yourself, preferably at launch or afterwards.
. The instance profile has https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-instance-profile.html[permissions to run SSM commands] on the EC2 instance. If you can't create a new or use any existing instance profile, use the one created by the solution, viz. `NRSSMInstanceProfile`. The solution creates the instance profile when you set the CloudFormation template paramater, `CreateEC2InstanceProfile` to `Yes`
. Add the tag with name `NR-Infrastructure` and value `Install`. This tag key-value pair allows the automation workflow to automatically install the New Relic Infrastructure agent on the EC2 instance, as soon as it is launched and in running state.

Once the EC2 instance is launched, connect to it using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html[AWS Systems Manager Session Manager], and once you are connected, run this command in the terminal.

`newrelic-infra --version`

You will see the New Relic Infrastructure agent version info. This confirms that the agent was successfully installed automatically on the EC2 instance as soon as it was launched, and you should now be able to monitor the instance from your New Relic account.

Log into your https://one.newrelic.com/[New Relic account] and navigate to https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer[Entity explorer] and look for the newly launched EC2 instance in the `Hosts` page. You can launch more instances using a variety of different AMIs supported by New Relic Infrastructure agent and you will see that they all automatically show up in your New Relic account.
