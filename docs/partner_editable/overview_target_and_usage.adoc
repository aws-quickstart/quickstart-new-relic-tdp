This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides instructions for deploying {partner-product-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for {partner-product-short-name} customers who use AWS to launch applications in https://aws.amazon.com/ec2[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)^] instances and monitor these instances, by using https://newrelic.com/integrations/aws-ec2-integration[New Relic's EC2 Infrastructure monitoring^] and the infrastructure agent.

The Quick Start aims at meetings these objectives: +

. Automate the process of deploying and managing the Infrastructure agent on EC2 instances across various operating systems and architectures.
. Control which EC2 instances to include for automatic installation of Infrastructure agent, using a tag on the instance. Creating a tag named`+NR-Infrastructure+` with a value of `+Install+` will deploy the agent on the EC2 instance.
. The solution works regardless of how https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/LaunchingAndUsingInstances.html[EC2 instances are launched^]. Using the Launch Instance Wizard in the https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS Management Console^], an EC2 auto-scaling group, AWS CloudFormation templates or CDK, AWS CLI or AWS SDKs, using a standard or https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/what-is-image-builder.html[golden AMI^], or using third party tools like https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform^].
. The solution launches a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html[StackSet^] so it can be easily deployed across multiple regions and accounts. This makes the installation of EC2 agent seamless across your multi-account, and multi-region AWS environment.
. If you have a large number of EC2 instances in your AWS account(s), and you want to monitor them with New Relic, the SSM Automation can be run on-demand so you can seamlessly install the Infrastructure agent using the automation targeting all instances.
. If you're using https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/[AWS Control Tower^], the template can be added into your https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/customize-landing-zone.html[AWS Control Tower landing zone customization^] to automatically deploy the solution for you every time a new account is enrolled.
. The solution works for EC2 instances running in https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/[AWS Outposts^].
