This guide provides instructions for deploying  {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for New Relic customers who use AWS to launch applications in https://aws.amazon.com/ec2[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)] instances and monitor these instances, by using https://newrelic.com/integrations/aws-ec2-integration[New Relic's EC2 Infrastructure monitoring] using the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent[Infrastructure agent].

The Quick Start aims at meetings these objectives: +

. Automate the process of deploying and managing the Infrastructure agent on EC2 instances across various https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html[AMI]s (based on operating system and architecture), using https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation] template. Prior to this, the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent[agent installtion process] was mostly manual, requiring customers to use native shell commands that would vary by the platform, making the process error prone and it did not scale well in a large AWS environment with ephermeral EC2 instances like those launched and terminated by https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html[Auto Scaling groups].
. Control which EC2 instances to include for automatic installation of Infrastructure agent, using a tag on the instance, viz. `+NR-Infrastructure+` set to `+Install+`.
. The solution works regardless of how https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/LaunchingAndUsingInstances.html[EC2 instances are launched], viz. using the Launch Instance Wizard in the https://aws.amazon.com/console/[AWS Management Console], from an EC2 auto-scaling group, using AWS CloudFormation template, https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS CLI] or https://aws.amazon.com/tools/[AWS SDKs], or using a standard or https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/what-is-image-builder.html[golden AMI], or using third party tools like https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform]. The solution will install the agent automatically, as soon as the instance is up and running, after it's launched.
. The solution launches a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html[StackSet] so it can be easily deployed across multiple regions and accounts. This makes the installation of EC2 agent seamless across your multi-account, and multi-region AWS environment.
. If you're using https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/[AWS Control Tower], the template can be added into your https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/customize-landing-zone.html[AWS Control Tower landing zone customization] to automatically deploy the solution for you every time a new account is enrolled.
. The solution works for EC2 instances running in https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/[AWS Outposts].
