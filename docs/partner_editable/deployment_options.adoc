This Quick Start provides the following deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} as CloudFormation StackSet*. This recommended option is useful when your environment includes EC2 instances that span across multiple Regions and accounts.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} as CloudFormation stack*. This option is useful for testing or troubleshooting, for example when you want to quickly deploy the stack in a given Region, and then test the automation to confirm that it works as expected.

The Quick Start provides a single template for both options. Use either the CloudFormation StackSet or Stack to launch the Quick Start.
