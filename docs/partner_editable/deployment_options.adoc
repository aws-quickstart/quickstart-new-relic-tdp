This Quick Start provides following deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} as CloudFormation StackSet*. This option is recommended and is especially useful when you are dealing with EC2 instances spanning across multiple regions and accounts.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} as CloudFormation Stack*. This option is mostly useful for testing or troubleshooting, where you want to quickly deploy the stack in a given region, and then test the automation to see if it works as you expect it to.

The Quick Start provides single template for these options. Use either CloudFormation StackSet or Stack to launch it.
