= AWS QuickStart for New Relic EC2 Infrastructure integration

New Relic Infrastructure's integrations include an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integration for reporting your EC2 metadata to New Relic products.
Customers can make use of the New Relic Infrastructure agent to get a comprehensive, real-time view of their EC2 instances performance and status. You must install the Infrastructure agent on each EC2 host to see metrics from that host.

The QuickStart relies on https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/[AWS Systems Manager] (SSM) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html[Automation] and requires that EC2 instances have the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html[SSM Agent] installed.
