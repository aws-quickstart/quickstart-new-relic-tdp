{partner-product-name} is used for reporting your EC2 metadata to {partner-company-name} products.
After you install the {partner-company-name} infrastructure agent on each EC2 host, you can view metrics from that host and get a comprehensive, real-time view of the performance and status of your EC2 instances. 

This Quick Start relies on AWS Systems Manager Automation for managing deployment tasks. AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) must be installed on all EC2 instances.
